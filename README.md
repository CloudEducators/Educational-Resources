Resources for educators - hardware facilities, software packages, services and the like

## Computing Resources

The National Science Foundation has funded a number of computing resources for educators and researchers.
* https://CloudLab.us - a front-end to a multi-site cloud infrastructure that lets you use bare metal and virtual instances. You can use this system to test your distributed systems or spin up your own (private) OpenStack instance.
* https://www.chameleoncloud.org/ - An OpenStack based system that serves a similar purpose at CloudLab. The system supports "appliances" that configure specific systems suitable for courses

There are also grants programs for private cloud providers:
* Amazon AWS - https://aws.amazon.com/grants/
* Microsoft Azure - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/community/education/
* Google Computer Engine - https://cloud.google.com/edu/

There are also free commercial services that simplify teaching with a cloud, including developing web applications and the like.
* Cloud9 - http://c9.io
* Heroku - https://dashboard.heroku.com/

## Hands-out 
This section aggregates publicly available educational materials that have been used in classrooms. Since all materials provided are in an "open source" format, we encourage people to contribute by improving the proposed materials or by adding new materials. The final scope is to define a standard "Cloud Computing Class" (CCC). Of course, all comments/contributions are more than welcome!

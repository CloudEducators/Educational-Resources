## Computing Resources

The National Science Foundation has funded a number of computing resources for educators and researchers.
* https://CloudLab.us - a front-end to a multi-site cloud infrastructure that lets you use bare metal and virtual instances. You can use this system to test your distributed systems or spin up your own (private) OpenStack instance.
* https://www.chameleoncloud.org/ - An OpenStack based system that serves a similar purpose at CloudLab. The system supports "appliances" that configure specific systems suitable for courses

There are also grants programs for private cloud providers:
* Amazon AWS - https://aws.amazon.com/grants/
* Microsoft Azure - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/community/education/
* Google Computer Engine - https://cloud.google.com/edu/

There are also free commercial services that simplify teaching with a cloud, including developing web applications and the like.
